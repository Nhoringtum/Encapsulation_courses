Here is a class exercice for oriented object programming in C++ language.
The goal is to make a small game with Player (move, life system, damage..), BreakableObject, Monster(move, damage, death..) and World. It's split by few small exercices.

It's my first C++ project.
Here the link of exercices : https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16M7eunT6KRor59FbwpU1rpdpvmNr_Db_PEAN249JGGI/edit#slide=id.g2a93297d5a3_1_30
